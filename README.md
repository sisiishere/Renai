# Renai
This is the second project of the GW bootcamp that focuses on matching people based on haikus liked. 
In fact, the second project is a dating app with an interesting twist...haikus! 
A haiku is a Japanese poem that has three lines; five syllables for the first and third lines and seven syllables for the second line.
Wait, there's more! There is also a profile page that is inclusive based on demographic status (gender, biological sex, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, age, preferred pronouns, etc.)!
But the main purpose is matching a person with the partner based on the haiku of one person liked by another one.

Running the tests
1. go to git bash and in the git repository directory, type in node server.js or nodemon server.js
2. if app is listening on the port number, go to localhost:(whatever portnumber shown (etc. 3000))
3. The localhost should see the demo of the site
4. If there is the cannot GET/, check the apiRoutes, htmlRoutes, server.js, and controllers files, and repeat steps 2 and 4 until you finally reach to step 3.
5. If there is an error instead of an app listening on the port, then repeat steps 1 and 5 until you finally reach to step 2.

Node server.js tests the localhost to see if the app is listening and also if the apiRoutes and/or htmlRoutes are shown.
